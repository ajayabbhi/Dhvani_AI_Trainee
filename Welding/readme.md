1.USER DRAWs 2LINES X AXIS(2 points )AND Y AXIS(2 points) by plotting 4points 
2.plot 3 points 
3.get coordinate values of all points using setmouseCallback 
4.from 2 lines drawn...find value of intersection point O(equations a 1 x + b 1 y + c 1 = 0 and a 2 x + b 2 y + c 2 = 0)
5.Find Distance 
           line 1 :euclidean distance b/w P1 and P2
           line 2 :euclidean distance b/w P0 and P2
           line 3 :euclidean distance b/w P0 and P3
           FIND MID POINT of line 1 let it (mx,my)
           line 4 :euclidean distance b/w P3 and (mx,my)
           line 5: euclidean distance b/w PO and P1
